# Building with Gradle
This Project uses gradle for automatic testing, building and releasing. Current version used is gradle 2.14. Any tasks for the gradle binary to execute are defined in [TDD-Trainer/build.gradle](TDD-Trainer/build.gradle). Executing these tasks requires a gradle setup. Consider getting one [here](http://gradle.org/gradle-download/) or see [Gradle Wrapper](#gradle-wrapper) below
